# Control an LED via Cloud
### An introduction to NodeMCU - ESP8366 and a basic program to control an LED via the cloud.  
<br/>

***Introduction to NodeMCU - ESP8266 :***  
ESP8266 is a low-cost WiFi-enabled microcontroller chip, produced by [Espressif Systems](https://www.espressif.com/en). [NodeMCU](https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html) is the development kit for the ESP8266 microcontroller. It is a low-cost open source IoT platform. It is one of the easiest ways to discover the capabilities of WiFi enabled chips.

As the chip comes with WiFi on board, it opens up many possibilities that are not generally possible with other beginner-friendly microcontroller development kits like Arduino Uno. One of the important feature of NodeMCU is its ability to connect to Cloud Technologies, such as [Arduino IoT Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc), [Blynk IoT Cloud](https://blynk.io/), [ThingSpeak IoT Cloud](https://thingspeak.com/), etc.

***About Arduino IoT Cloud :***  
It is an online cloud platform, that makes it easy for us to collect data, monitor and control devices over the air. It's UI is simple, and easy to navigate and explore. Arduino Cloud has a free plan with limitations, along with some paid subscriptions that give more contorl over the data. It provides us with both a web app for desktop, as well as a mobile application for both iOS and Android. For this project, we are using Arduino Cloud along with NodeMCU to control the LED.

***Project Overview :***  
A simple project that demonstrates the basics of Arduino Cloud in integration with NodeMCU. A simple "On-Off" switch is designed in the Arduino Cloud dashboard to control the working of the LED.  

***Required Components :***  
- NodeMCU - ESP8266
- LED (any colour)
- Resistor (1k Ohm)
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
<br/>  

***Software Requirements :***
- Arduino IDE ([Download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software))
- Arduino IoT Cloud ([Register](https://cloud.arduino.cc))
- Drivers for NodeMCU ([Download](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit/tree/master/Drivers))
<br/>  

***Connections :***  
Use a breadboard for connections.
- Connect the D0 pin of the NodeMCU with Anode of LED via a resistor.
- Cathode of the LED is connected to ground.
